# Employee-Management

The Employee Management API provides a set of RESTful endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete employee records. This API is designed to manage employee data effectively, allowing for seamless integration with various frontend interfaces.

Key Features:


Auto-Generation of Employee Registration ID (regid): Each employee is assigned a unique registration ID in the format EMPXXX (e.g., EMP001, EMP002, etc.), which is auto-generated based on the total number of employees in the database.
Comprehensive Employee Data Management: The API supports operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee records, with validations in place to ensure data integrity.
